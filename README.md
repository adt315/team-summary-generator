## Description
This is a command line application that takes in information about employees on a team, and then generates an HTML file that displays a summary of each of the employees on the team.  The user is asked questions about each employee's information, and they can add as many employees on the team as they would like.  This application uses Node, the Inquirer npm package, Jest, CSS, and HTML.
